# Eterna - Elegant Jewelry E-Commerce Platform ðŸ’Ž

Eterna is an elegant jewelry e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience. This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, utilizing React and TypeScript for the front-end and Firebase for authentication and data handling. Future iterations will transition the backend to Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

### Built with

#### Frontend
- React & TypeScript â€“ For a modular and scalable UI.
- SCSS â€“ For responsive and maintainable styling.
- React Router â€“ For seamless navigation.
- Vite â€“ For fast and efficient development.

#### Backend
- Firebase Authentication â€“ For secure user sign-in/sign-up.
- Firestore (temporary) â€“ For initial product data handling (soon to be replaced with PostgreSQL).

#### Other Tools
- One.com â€“ Hosting for the front-end.
- Cloudinary (planned) â€“ For optimized product image storage.
- PostgreSQL (future update) â€“ For advanced product management and user data.

### How It Works

- Shopping Experience
  - Users can browse and explore various jewelry categories.
  - Clicking a product shows detailed information.
- Authentication
  - Users can sign in with an email & password or Google Sign-In.
  - Upon authentication, their email is displayed in the navigation.
- Shopping Cart
  - Users can add and remove products from their cart.
  - The cart icon dynamically updates with the number of selected items.

### What I learned

This project allowed me to:
- Enhance my skills in React & TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable code.
- Work with Firebase Authentication for a modern user authentication system.
- Implement a shopping cart system with React state management.
- Optimize styling with SCSS for a polished UI.

### Continued development

Future updates will include:
- Migrating Firestore to Node.js & PostgreSQL for better data management.
- Adding a checkout and payment gateway for real transactions.
- Optimizing images with Cloudinary for faster loading.
- Implementing user order history and wishlists.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dantvi/eterna.git
cd eterna
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

The project will now run on localhost:5173 (Vite default port).
